# Paths aka "Tunnelbird", a game made with Godot 4.2
All code and assets were created by me. 

I used GDScript for the logic and mechanics and used Aseprite to make the art and animations.

I created this game as an exercise in simple maze algorithms and procedurally generated levels as well as solo project development and the freedom and challenges it brings.
